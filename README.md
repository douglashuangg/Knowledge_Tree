# Knowledge_Tree
Building an application that allows you to quickly make knowledge trees.

# Motivation
* Learning effectively is all about connecting things together
* Too many university lectures don't teach how things fit into the big picture and why it is important
* Helpful to create a knowledge graph to see where what I am currently learning fits into the big picture
* Future focus would also be able to explore different people's mind maps on all sorts of topics

Tech Stack
* PostgreSQL
* React
* Node
